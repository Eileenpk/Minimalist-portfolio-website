## Overview

In this project, I used a combination of modern web development technologies and techniques to build a responsive, feature-rich website with a robust form submission system.

First, I used semantic HTML5 markup to structure the content of the website in a way that was easily understandable by both humans and machines. This helped improve the search engine optimization of the website, as well as make it more accessible to users with disabilities.

I then used Tailwind CSS to create the visual design of the website. This allowed me to quickly and easily create a clean and consistent look and feel for the website without having to write a lot of custom CSS. I also used CSS custom properties to make the website more flexible and customizable.

To make the website responsive, I relied on Flexbox and Grid to create flexible and adaptable layouts that would work well on a wide range of devices. I also adopted a mobile-first workflow, which meant that I focused on designing and developing for mobile devices first, and then added additional styles and functionality for larger screens.

I used React.js and Next JS to build the frontend of the website, which made it easy to create reusable components and manage the website's data and state. I also used Graphql to handle the data fetching and manipulation, which allowed me to create a more efficient and performant website.

For the website's form submission system, I used Hygraph CMS and Formspree. This allowed me to easily create and manage the website's forms, and securely handle the submission and processing of form data. Overall, this project was a great example of how modern web development technologies can be used together to create a powerful and effective website.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Click the "About Me" call-to-action on the homepage and have the screen scroll down to the next section
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show error message
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show error message
